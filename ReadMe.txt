The "mc" application is a testing home made project, to give an experience working with rasters images. It implements an enhanced old school technique working with shifting palettes. The sence of enhancing is that old technique allowed working with palette, restricted by only 256 color indexes (reflected on screen at the same moment),  whereas new methos allows wotking with much more lengths.

While the process, the palette itself will be changed permanently, so the image will no repeat nowhen. Also it allow to playing with some key options, participated to making initial color matrix at the begin of process.
